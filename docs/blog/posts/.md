## Update in Subnet Structure

We are making important changes to improve fairness and protect miners' intellectual property: 

<!-- more -->

1. **Submission Information Hidden**  
   From today, submission details, especially **Docker Hub IDs** will no longer be visible.  
   - Reason: We observed that some of the highest-scored scripts were developed by a single miner but submitted by multiple miners, leading to unfair distribution of effort and rewards.  
   - This ensures each miner fully owns their intellectual property.

2. **Encryption Check for Submissions**  
   We noticed attempts to bypass similarity checks using encrypted submissions.  
   - To address this, we have integrated an **encryption detection system**.  
   - Each submission will now be checked carefully, and if encryption is detected, the `reason` field in `comparison_logs` will clearly explain the issue.

These updates are designed to keep the system fair, transparent, and supportive of minersâ€™ contributions.
